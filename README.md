# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Duration

The purpose of this analysis is to accurately predict the duration of taxi trips in New York City. This work is for a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration). To make our predictions, we will use a feed-forward neural network using TensorFlow, a RandomForest Regressor, Lightgbm, and Catboost. Random search will be used to find the optimal network architecture and hyperparameter values for each model.

Currently, this method has me ranked in the top 13% of the 200+ teams.
